# A comparison of mean and median daily transaction values across five blockchains based on Bitcoin

This analysis was created as part of my application to work as a data scientist with [coin metrics](https://coinmetrics.io).

It analyses on chain data by comparing the median daily transaction value to the mean daily transaction value (converted to USD).
It's central hypothesis is that if the mean value is significantly higher than the median, then blockchain activity is dominated by "whales" and the blockchains user base is not organic.

As far as I am aware, this is a novel indicator. 

I would call this mean-median ratio a blockchains "MMR".

It is a very brief analysis - the suggested time to spend on this exercise was only 4 hours. 

There are some large untested assumptions, and most of the work remains to be done before the analysis could be applied in practice.
