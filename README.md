# A comparison of mean and median daily transaction values across five blockchains based on Bitcoin

This analysis was created as part of my application to work as a data scientist with [Coin Metrics](https://coinmetrics.io).

It analyses on-chain data by comparing the median daily transaction value to the mean daily transaction value. A blockchains mean-median ratio could be known as its MMR.

The usefulness of the MMR metric relies on the assumption that if the mean value is significantly higher than the median, then blockchain activity is dominated by "whales" instead of by organic day-to-day use by the blckchains intended users.

As far as I am aware, this is a novel indicator. 

This analysis is very brief - the suggested time to spend on this exercise was only 4 hours. 

There are some importantk untested assumptions, most of the work remains to be done before the analysis could be applied in practice.
